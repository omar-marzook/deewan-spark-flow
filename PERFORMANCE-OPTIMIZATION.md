## Performance Optimization Principles

The Deewan website follows these core performance principles:

1. **Minimize Initial Load Time**: Prioritize above-the-fold content and defer non-critical resources
2. **Optimize Asset Delivery**: Compress and cache assets appropriately
3. **Reduce JavaScript Execution**: Minimize main thread work and defer non-critical JS
4. **Optimize Images**: Use modern formats, responsive sizing, and lazy loading
5. **Implement Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works without JS
6. **Monitor Real User Metrics**: Track and analyze actual user performance data

## Current Optimizations

### Image Optimization

#### Implementation Details

- **WebP Compression Quality**: Reduced from 80 to 75 for better compression while maintaining visual quality
  - File: `scripts/optimize-images.js`
  - Impact: ~10-15% smaller file sizes with minimal visual quality loss

- **Responsive Images Generation**:
  - Automatically creates multiple sizes (small: 400px, medium: 800px, large: 1200px)
  - Generates both original format and WebP versions
  - File: `scripts/optimize-images.js`

- **OptimizedImage Component Usage**:
  - All images should use the OptimizedImage component which:
    - Selects appropriate image size based on viewport
    - Provides WebP with fallback to original format
    - Implements native lazy loading
    - Includes proper width/height to prevent layout shifts

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

```tsx
// CORRECT: Use OptimizedImage component
<OptimizedImage 
  src={industry.image} 
  alt={industry.title}
  width={400}
  height={300}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>

// AVOID: Direct img tags
<img src={industry.image} alt={industry.title} />
```

### JavaScript Optimizations

#### Implementation Details

- **LazyLoad Component**:
  - File: `src/components/ui/lazy-load.tsx`
  - Uses IntersectionObserver for efficient detection of viewport entry
  - Defers rendering of components until they're near the viewport
  - Applied to below-the-fold components like DepartmentsWeServe and AlternativeTestimonials

- **Code Splitting**:
  - Vite's built-in code splitting for route-based chunking
  - Dynamic imports for large components that aren't immediately needed

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

```tsx
// CORRECT: Lazy load below-the-fold components
import LazyLoad from "../components/ui/lazy-load";

// In your component render function:
<LazyLoad>
  <HeavyComponent />
</LazyLoad>

// CORRECT: Use dynamic imports for large components
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

// Then use with Suspense:
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <HeavyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

### CSS Optimizations

#### Implementation Details

- **PurgeCSS Integration**:
  - Configured in `postcss.config.js`
  - Removes unused CSS in production builds
  - Significantly reduces CSS bundle size

- **CSS Minification**:
  - Enabled in production builds
  - Removes whitespace, comments, and optimizes selectors

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

- Use utility classes from Tailwind when possible
- Avoid large CSS imports in components
- Consider component-specific CSS to improve tree-shaking

### Font Optimizations

#### Implementation Details

- **Preload Critical Fonts**:
  - File: `src/components/SEO.tsx`
  - Preloads Gilroy Bold and Regular fonts which are used in above-the-fold content
  - Improves First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- **Font Display Strategy**:
  - Uses `font-display: swap` to ensure text remains visible during font loading
  - Prevents invisible text during page load

- **Resource Hints**:
  - Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for Google Fonts
  - Establishes early connections to font providers

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

- Minimize font variations (weights, styles) to only those actually used
- Consider using variable fonts for multiple weights with smaller file size
- Ensure text remains visible during webfont load with font-display: swap

### Service Worker Enhancements

#### Implementation Details

- **Third-party Resource Caching**:
  - File: `public/service-worker.js`
  - Implements stale-while-revalidate strategy for third-party resources
  - Reduces repeat requests to external services

- **Offline Support**:
  - File: `public/offline.html`
  - Custom offline page with consistent design language
  - Provides graceful degradation when network is unavailable

- **Caching Strategies**:
  - Static assets: Cache-first strategy
  - HTML/API: Network-first with offline fallback
  - Third-party resources: Stale-while-revalidate

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

- Register the service worker in production environments
- Test offline functionality regularly
- Consider which resources should be available offline

### Server Optimizations

#### Implementation Details

- **Compression Middleware**:
  - File: `server/production.js`
  - Uses Express compression middleware
  - Reduces transfer size of text-based assets

- **Caching Headers**:
  - File: `server/production.js`
  - Static assets: 1 year cache (max-age=31536000)
  - HTML and API responses: no-cache to ensure fresh content

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

- Ensure new API endpoints follow the same caching principles
- Consider ETags for resources that change infrequently but unpredictably

### Third-party Script Optimizations

#### Implementation Details

- **Defer Non-critical Scripts**:
  - Analytics and other non-essential third-party scripts are loaded with defer attribute
  - Prevents blocking of main thread during initial page load

- **Resource Hints for Third-party Domains**:
  - Preconnect to domains that will be used soon
  - Reduces connection setup time

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

```tsx
// CORRECT: Load third-party scripts with defer
useEffect(() => {
  const script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://analytics-url.com/script.js';
  script.defer = true;
  document.body.appendChild(script);
  
  return () => {
    document.body.removeChild(script);
  };
}, []);

// AVOID: Synchronous script loading
<script src="https://analytics-url.com/script.js"></script>
```

### Performance Monitoring

#### Implementation Details

- **Web Vitals Tracking**:
  - File: `src/lib/web-vitals.ts`
  - Tracks Core Web Vitals and other important metrics:
    - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
    - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
    - INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
    - FCP (First Contentful Paint)
    - TTFB (Time to First Byte)
  - Integrated in `src/main.tsx`

- **Reporting**:
  - Currently logs to console in production
  - Can be extended to send to analytics service

#### Usage Guidelines for Developers

- Monitor Web Vitals after significant changes
- Pay special attention to LCP and CLS when adding new components
- Consider implementing custom performance marks for component-specific metrics

## Implementation Guide for New Components

When adding new components to the Deewan website, follow these guidelines to maintain optimal performance:

### 1. Image Handling

- Always use the OptimizedImage component for images
- Provide proper width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts
- Consider if the image should be lazy-loaded based on its position

### 2. Component Loading

- For large components not visible in the initial viewport:
  - Wrap in the LazyLoad component
  - Consider using React.lazy() with Suspense for code splitting

### 3. CSS Considerations

- Use Tailwind utility classes when possible
- Keep component-specific CSS minimal
- Avoid large CSS imports

### 4. JavaScript Efficiency

- Minimize state changes that trigger re-renders
- Use memoization (useMemo, useCallback) for expensive calculations
- Consider the impact on Time to Interactive (TTI)

### 5. Third-party Resources

- Load non-critical third-party scripts with defer
- Consider the performance impact of third-party components

## Verification Process

To verify that all performance optimizations are correctly implemented:

1. Run the performance optimization verification script:

```bash
node scripts/setup-performance-optimizations.js
```

2. Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to measure performance metrics
3. Test on slower devices and connections to ensure good performance for all users
4. Monitor Web Vitals in production

## Future Optimization Roadmap

Consider these additional optimizations for further performance improvements:

1. **Critical CSS Extraction**:
   - Automatically extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading

2. **Dynamic Import for Routes**:
   - Implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
   - Further reduce initial bundle size

3. **Preload Key Resources**:
   - Add preload hints for critical resources based on analytics data
   - Prioritize resources that impact LCP

4. **Image CDN Integration**:
   - Consider using a dedicated image CDN for global edge caching
   - Automatic format selection based on browser support

5. **HTTP/2 Server Push**:
   - Implement for critical assets if supported by hosting infrastructure
   - Reduce round trips for important resources

6. **Intersection Observer for More Components**:
   - Extend usage of Intersection Observer beyond lazy loading
   - Implement for animations, video playback, etc.
